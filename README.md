## [HedgeSage](https://denk1k.github.io/hedgesage/) uses 13F filings to:
* Aggregates current hedge fund positions
* Backtests the funds' original performance
* Simulates returns that would have been achieved by copying the hedge funds
  * With manager-weighted allocation
  * And same but with investment scaled to the entire account
* And shows all of this within a neat and minimal UI :)
